This project provides a scaffold for a FastAPI microservice designed for YouTube content automation. It includes four key services: a transcribe service, a thumbnail creation service, a metadata service, and an upload service.

## Services

1. **Transcribe Service:** Translates audio tracks from videos into text.
2. **Thumbnail Creation Service:** Automates the generation of video thumbnails.
3. **Metadata Service:** Handles video metadata, including titles, descriptions, and tags.
4. **Upload Service:** Automates the uploading of videos to YouTube, integrating YouTube's API for video uploads.
